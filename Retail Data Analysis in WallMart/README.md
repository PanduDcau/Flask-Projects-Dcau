## 1. Project Motivation <a name="ProjectMotivation"></a> 

**In this project we focused retail analysis with Walmart data and answer the following questions:**
1. Which stores have maximum  and sales?
2. Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot?. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation.
3. Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3â€™2012?
4. Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together.
5. Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights.
6. Build prediction to forecast demand.

## 3. Data<a name="data"></a> 

There are sales data available for 45 stores of Walmart in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/aditya6196/retail-analysis-with-walmart-data). This is the data that covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. 



## 4. Implementation <a name="model"></a> 
In this project, we used [RandomForestRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html) and [LinearRegression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) to predict of sales. The data have been split into training and testing with a ratio of 80:20.
