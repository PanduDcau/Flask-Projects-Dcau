# Introduction

PDF or Portable Document File format is one of the most common file formats in today’s time. It is widely used across every industry such as in government offices, healthcare, and even in personal work. As a result, there is a large unstructured data that exists in PDF format and extracting this data to generate meaningful insights is a common work among data scientists.

There are several Python libraries dedicated to working with PDF documents such as PYPDF2 etc. In this tutorial, I will be using [Camelot](https://pypi.org/project/camelot-py/)

##### You are in control: Unlike other libraries and tools which either give a nice output or fail miserably (with no in-between), Camelot gives you the power to tweak table extraction. (This is important since everything in the real world, including PDF table extraction, is fuzzy.)

##### Bad tables can be discarded based on metrics like accuracy and whitespace, without ever having to manually look at each table.

##### Each table is a pandas DataFrame, which seamlessly integrates into ETL and data analysis workflows.

#####  Export to multiple formats, including JSON, Excel, HTML, and Sqlite.

## Let’s Begin

Before installing Camelot libraries we have to install ghost script , once we install the [ghost script](https://www.ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) lets install camelot-py.
