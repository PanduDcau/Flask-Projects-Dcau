Feature Maps are generated by element-wise multiplication and addition of corresponding images with Filters consisting of multiple Feature Detectors. This allows the creation of multiple Feature Maps.\n",

It makes sure that your Neural Network has Spatial Invariance (able to find learned features in new images that are slightly varied or distorted). Max Pooling provides resilience against shifter or rotated features. It also further distills Feature Maps (reduces size) while preserving spatial relationships of pixels. Removing unnecessary information also helps prevent overfitting. Read 'Evaluation of Pooling Operations in Convolutional Architectures for Object Recognition.pdf'.
