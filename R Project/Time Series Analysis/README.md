# Building a Time Series Dynamic App with Shiny

**Streaming data** is data that is created in real time and comes from a variety of sources, including sensors, log files, GIS services, and so on. The data may arrive at regular intervals, and we may want a dashboard that automatically refreshes and includes the new data so that we may utilize it for data-driven decision making.

***The dashborad updates automatically to incorporate newly added data.***

 ```
To establish a reactive data source in shiny, we utilize the Reactive polling function, which works by querying a non-reactive data source on a regular basis.
 ```

 This Code makes use of the libraries, [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), and [tidy.r](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/introducing-tidyr/).
