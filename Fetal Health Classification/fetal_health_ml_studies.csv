"Mandala, 2023","This study evaluates the use of machine learning models to predict fetal health using CTG data, incorporating fetal heart rate, uterine contractions, and maternal blood pressure. The models applied include LightGBM, Random Forests, and TabNet, achieving high accuracies between 93% and 98.31%.","LightGBM, Random Forests, TabNet","LightGBM, Random Forests, TabNet (93% to 98.31%)"
"Nagavibha et al., 2024","This study emphasizes ML models for classifying fetal health using CTG data. Models such as Random Forests, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Classifiers, Voting Classes, and K-Nearest Neighbours were used. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 93%.","Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVC, Voting Classifiers, K-NN",Random Forest (93%)
"Gaddam, Maheswari and Chennupalle, 2023","The research investigates using machine learning models for fetal health classification, including ultrasound images. XGBoost and Random Forest were utilized, with Random Forest performing best for normal and suspect classes. The Random Forest model's predictions were interpreted using Explainable AI (XAI).","XGBoost, Random Forest",Random Forest (best precision for normal and suspect classes)
