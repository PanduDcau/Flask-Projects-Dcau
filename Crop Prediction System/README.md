# Crop-Prediction
This model recommends the optimum crop for a certain field based on rainfall, soil nutrient levels, and climatic conditions in several regions of the Indian subcontinent. As a result, this application will give information on agricultural land in various cities and districts, such as whether the area is appropriate for cultivation of the crop selected or not. This programme also gives information about appropriate land for specific forms of farming.
* I compared various machine learning approaches for getting the best result and used [XGBoost Algorithm](https://towardsdatascience.com/https-medium-com-vishalmorde-xgboost-algorithm-long-she-may-rein-edd9f99be63d) for the application.
* Just now the project is in the development phase and I need to make the model much accurate and reliable.
### How to install the project in your local environment
* Add project to your local dekstop using ```git clone ss```
* Now, change the directory of your terminal to ```cd Server```
* run command ```python app.py``` to run the app.py file in Server folder (app.py is the backend part of the project).
