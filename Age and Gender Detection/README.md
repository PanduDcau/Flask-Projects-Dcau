# [Age and Gender Detection using OpenCV in Python](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/gender-and-age-detection-using-opencv-python)
To run this:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- Check [the tutorial](https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/gender-and-age-detection-using-opencv-python) for more information on how to set this up.
- After you download the models weights and architectures, you can perform age & gender detection on any image:
    ```
    $ python age_and_gender_detection.py images/kids.jpg
    ```
- You can also use your camera, via the `age_and_gender_detection_live.py` script.
